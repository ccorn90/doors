Door Detection Using Superpixels

The project centers in the DoorDetector object, which is fed an Image object and a vector<CPoly>, and outputs a vector of DoorObject.
DoorObject and LineSegment are two helper objects.

This project uses the Eriol framework for image viewing.  It will be helpful to know some keyboard commands:

_Basic Eriol Commands_
To zoom in and out: '+' and '-'
To increase window size: '<' and '>'
To toggle display of polygon overlays: '@'

_Door-Detection Eriol Commands_
To run door-detection method: '#'
To select an image to view: '[' and ']'
To choose a polygon overlay to view: '{' and '}'
After running the detection code, polygons may be displayed but all-messed-up. If so, zoom out and then back in again, using '+' and '-' ... this is a bug, it is confusing, and it's most likely not our fault.
