--- Code structure overview ---
The project centers in the DoorDetector object, which is fed an Image object and a vector<CPoly>, and outputs a vector of DoorObject.
DoorObject and LineSegment are two helper objects.

--- Working environments ---
Currently configured to work on recent Fedora versions.  Mac OS X is coming soon but has not been implemented in the Makefile yet.

--- External Dependancies, to best of knowledge ---
openMP parallel execution library
OpenGL, GLUT

--- To get started ---
"make run" ought to compile and run the demonstration executable.  Some commands may be helpful once you get to the GUI image viewer:
To zoom in and out: '+' and '-'
To increase window size: '<' and '>'
To toggle display of polygon overlays: '@'
To run door-detection method: '#'
To select an image to view: '[' and ']'
To choose a polygon overlay to view: '{' and '}'
